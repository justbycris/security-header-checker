# 🔒 Security Headers Checker

A web application that analyzes HTTP security headers of any website and provides a security score with actionable recommendations.

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool helps developers and security professionals quickly audit websites for common security header misconfigurations. It checks for essential security headers and provides educational information about each one.

## 🚀 Version 1.0 (Current)
✅ Real-time header analysis
✅ Security scoring (0-100)
✅ 7 critical headers checked
✅ Detailed explanations
✅ Actionable recommendations

## 🔮 Roadmap (V2.0)
⏳ Historical tracking
⏳ Bulk domain analysis
⏳ Confidence scores
⏳ Export reports as PDF
⏳ SSL/TLS certificate analysis

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Header Analysis**: Fetch and analyze security headers from any URL
- **Security Scoring**: Get an overall security score based on header presence and configuration
- **Detailed Explanations**: Learn what each security header does and why it matters
- **Best Practice Recommendations**: Receive specific suggestions to improve security posture
- **Visual Dashboard**: Color-coded results showing passing/failing headers

## 🔍 Headers Checked

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME-type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information leakage
- **Permissions-Policy**: Controls browser feature access
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Legacy XSS filter (deprecated but still checked)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **HTTP Client**: Axios

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-headers-checker.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd security-headers-checker

# Install dependencies

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Enter a website URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)
2. Click "Check Headers"
3. View the security analysis results
4. Review recommendations for missing or misconfigured headers

## 📝 API Endpoint

```
POST /api/check-headers
Body: { "url": "https://example.com" }
Response: {
  "headers": { ... },
  "score": 85,
  "results": [ ... ],
  "recommendations": [ ... ]
}
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- CORS is enabled for development (restrict in production)
- User input is validated and sanitized
- No sensitive data is stored
- All requests are logged for monitoring

## 🎓 Educational Value

This project demonstrates understanding of:

- Common web security vulnerabilities
- HTTP security headers and their purposes
- Security best practices and OWASP guidelines
- Full-stack development with security focus

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add SSL/TLS certificate analysis
- [ ] Implement historical tracking of header changes
- [ ] Add comparison feature for multiple domains
- [ ] Export reports as PDF
- [ ] Add API rate limiting
- [ ] Implement caching for faster repeat checks
